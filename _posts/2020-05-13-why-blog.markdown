I often read blogs written by others and find them both useful and entertaining. And I admire folks who can write interesting stuff. Although I have wished that I could write a blog that someone might find useful, either I didn't find a topic that I felt strong enough to write about or if I did find something that I felt strongly about I didn't make an effort put my thoughts on paper. Recently I had a change in mindset which prompted me to start writing a blog. It was that I should write something that **_I_** would find useful rather than thinking about who else would. If there is something that I could write that would help me, I'm sure there might be atleast few others in the world that might find some use from it. And even if that was not the case, the fact that I would find it useful should be good enough to write it down somewhere. So why not in a blog?
