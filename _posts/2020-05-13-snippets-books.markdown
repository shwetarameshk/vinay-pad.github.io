title:  "Snippets from Books I Liked"
categories: blog

I have always found it difficult to recall plots of movies and shows I loved watching, summaries of books, articles I loved reading. I wish I could remember things I loved reading and watching at appropriate times. I'm always amazed at people who quickly recall relevant quotes from books, dialogues from movies at appropriate moments during a conversation that helps make their point stick.

Now that I have been reading a lot recently, I started saving snippets of paragraphs I liked as photos on my phone organized by albums named after the books I was reading. I hoped to go back and referto these often so I would remember the snippets I loved reading. But how often do we actually go back and see old photos on our phones? As I was reading the latest book, taking pics of the snippets I liked I realized I could go back to the pics and convert them into a blog post. If anything these posts would be easier for me to refer to if I ever needed to than scanning through pics on my phone. This post is an effort to do that. I will update the list of links below as I convert more of snippets I have saved into blog posts.
