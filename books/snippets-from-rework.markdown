[ReWork](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) is a book that talks about avoiding the fluff and focusing on the most important parts of building a business. While the focus is on building a business, the principles can also be applied when managing a team within a company, which is what I do.

### Stand for Something
>When you don’t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious. For example, Whole Foods stands for selling the highest quality natural and organic products available. they don’t wast time deciding over and over again what’s appropriate. No one asks, “Should we sell this product that has artificial flavors?” There’s no debate. The answer is clear. That’s why you can’t buy a coke or a Snickers there.

Agree on what are the most important attributes for your team. Write them down. For example, is thorough documentation important for your team? Even if it means taking longer to ship features? Write that down. Does your team prefer breaking down  large projects into milestones of max 1 month? Write that down as well. Put these into your team charter or a shared document.
Use these attributes when having a discussion about tradeoffs for a feature, deadlines, disagreements on technical choices etc. They will help ground the discussions and drive to a decision faster.

### Prioritization
>And a quick suggestion about prioritization: Don't prioritize with numbers or labels. Avoid saying, "This is high priority, this is low priority." Likewise, don't say, "This is a three, this is a two, this is a one, this is a three," etc. Instead, prioritize visually. Put the most important thing at the tip. When you're done with that, the nest thing on the list becomes the next important thing. That way you'll only have a single next most important thing to do at a time.

When I first became a manager everything on a list of features was important and the team worked hard to complete all of it in a quarter. This obviously didn't work very well and we usually ended up not finishing even a single feature completely. After a few such quarters we started treating the list of features differently. There was one single most important feature that we wanted to work on during a quarter. Everything else was not as important as the first one. This forced us to think hard which feature we wanted to really prioritize and have laser focus on.

### Let's create a Policy!
>The second something goes wrong, the natural tendency is to create a policy. "Someone's wearing shorts!? We need a dress code!" No, you don't. You just need to tell John not to wear shorts again. Policies are organizational scar tissue. They are codified overreactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again. No one sets out to create a bureaucracy. They sneak up on companies slowly.

Do you need everyone to be at the standup on time? Sure, create a policy. Do you need everyone to communicate any delays on tasks they are working on? Sure, create a policy for that as well. These kinda policies make sense since they would hamper team productivity if not consistently applied.
But do you need someone to get approval from a chain of managers if they want to try a new tool that they think might be better suited for a task? Or create a ticket for even the tiniest of tasks that account for every minute of their working day?Focus on creating policies that help the whole team and not necessarily those that help only you as a manager or folks up the chain. There is a healthy balance between policies that help management keep track of how teams are doing vs policies that force a team to spend absurd amounts of time satisfying it vs focusing on actual work.

### Estimates Suck
>We're all terrible estimators. We think we can guess how long something will take, when we really have no idea. Even with simple tasks, our estimates are often off by a factor of two or more. How can we expect to accurately predict the length of a "six-month project"? The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You're probably still going to get it wrong, but you'll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.

Leaders at a company are always big on "planning". While the intent is good, it invariably leads to estimations of every possible feature. This is not a good thing. Turn the table back and ask "If you could deliver only one feature for the entire quarter what would that be?". You can then basically repeat that question over and over and build out a "priority list" of features and estimate just the top 2 or 3. You're probably not gonna be able to get to more than those anyway. This strategy has 2 advantages,
It forces the PMs to really think about what's the most important feature.
It lets you break projects down into smaller tasks that can be estimated better.

### Be Authentic
>Talk to customers the way you would to friends. Avoid jargon or any sort of corporate-speak. Stay away from buzzwords when normal words will do just fine. Don't talk about "monetization" or being "transparent"; talk about making money and being honest. Don't use seven words when four will do... Whenever you write something, read it out loud. Does it sound the way it would if you were actually talking to someone? If not, how can you make it more conversational? 

Stop using We instead of I when it's pretty obvious you are talking about yourself with your team. It feels disingenuous to say "We need to do a better job of communicating deadlines and need to come up with a process for it." vs "I missed communicating the deadline this time. I will make sure it's done before we start planning from next quarter". The latter shows you are vulnerable enough to admit mistakes and learn from it which is a powerful thing to do.
And don't make something sound more complicated than it needs to be. "How many days of work is remaining on this task?" sounds a whole lot more authentic than "Can you come up with a break down of points completed and remaining on this task?" and also far fewer words. 

### Toxic Meetings
>They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per minute. They require thorough preparation that most people don't have time for. They frequently have agendas so vague that nobody is really sure of the goal. Meetings procreate. One meeting leads to another meeting leads to another. It's also unfortunate that meetings are typically scheduled like TV shows. You set aside thirty minutes or an hour because that's how scheduling software works (you'll never see anyone schedule a seven-minute meeting). If it only takes seven minutes to accomplish a meeting's goal, then that's all the time you should spend. Don't stretch seven into thirty.

Even though everyone knows to many meetings are bad, you still end up seeing those meeting invites that you don't really need to be on.Meetings should be a last resort to solve problems. Even when you do have to end up having a meeting, start with the lowest number of people you need. Don't add someone to a meeting unless they absolutely need to be there. A half hour meeting with 8 people is 4 hours + context switch time per person * 8. That's a huge time investment, so you better be absolutely sure you need it.
